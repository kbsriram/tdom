# TDom

This is a tiny standalone library
([one java file](/kbsriram/tdom/blob/master/src/core/org/tdom/TDom.java))
that lets you succinctly create and manipulate DOM-like tree
structures and render it into HTML or other textual formats.

See the [getting started](http://kbsriram.github.com/tdom/ "Getting Started")
documentation to get going with this library.

You can simply add the [java file](/kbsriram/tdom/blob/master/src/core/org/tdom/TDom.java))
to your source, or
[download tdom.jar](/kbsriram/tdom/raw/master/bin/tdom.jar)
and add it to your project.
